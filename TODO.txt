TODO/Thoughts:
 * Clean hJob, hMaterial, hMesh, hCoordinates 
 * Finish spherePacking script in Matlab to have hard limit on input for Abaqus, add method in hCoords
 * Carbon Nanotubes
 * Deterministic particle placement
 * More TDD when time permits.
 * Investigate clustering more, add more checks for delta to ensure particles work.
 * Limit ODB output.
 * MC vs Optimization vs ML. Which is most appropriate. Let scipy do the work.
 * Add method to close the txt file if it encounters error/force quit. 
 * Find alternative to having "example" files that iterate through steps for data.
 * Add more shapes, also add single giant particle examples.
 * Deal with infinite loops in meshing. Also output to screen iteration number
	and simulation type.
 * Update README
 * Config file for loading all the modules?
 * Now rewrite to generate TONS of INP files for submission to HPC.
 * Need to figure out if I have to limit data generated, or how to access ODB files at cluster
